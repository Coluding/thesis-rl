## Structure

### Java

Currently you can find a mockup of the Java project structure in the `java` directory which mocks a simulation of graph based network 

- `simulation` directory contains the simulation code
  - `src` directory contains the source code
    - `main` directory contains the main code
      - `MockSimulation.java` is the main class used to run the simulation
      - `IntervalRequest.java` is the class that represents the network state after each interval


### Python
